TODO:

- Create a unique id for points
- Draw the base (0) as a plane
- Show altitude layers:
    - 0 = bedrock
    - 62 = sea level
    - 127 = clouds
- Color code boxes by "type"
- Change zoom (translationsPerAxis[2]) based on the extent of points (try to show all of them concisely)
- Instead of drop downs, show a table (react-virtualized), when hovering over row, highlight the point

Dream TODO:

- Take picture of screen
- Extract coordinates from picture
- Ask user for name of point
- Show picture of point when user highlights row in table
